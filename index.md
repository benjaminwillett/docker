## Welcome to my Docker container Pages

Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications, whether on laptops, data center VMs, or the cloud.

### Docker Community Edition (CE)

Docker CE is available for free and is ideal for developers and small teams looking to get started with Docker to build container apps. Docker CE offers a monthly or quarterly release cadence for both the adventurous and practical developer.

### Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) 

Docker EE is a subscription of software, support and certification for enterprise dev and IT teams building and managing critical apps in production at scale. Docker EE is a Containers-as-a-Service platform for IT that manages and secures diverse applications across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.
